    <p>  For my research project this term I plan to look into the growing network called Bitcoin, and 
      the environmental impact it has. Already in the last year Bitcoin alone, along with its millions of users,
      racked up more power than the entire country of Norway. Many people have addressed this issue but I have
      yet to see any progress towards a global solution. The extreme amount of power usage is mainly created by 
      “puzzles” that are released every 10 minutes to users, in order to win freshly minted coins you must use 
      the most power and solve an intricate puzzle made of numbers. These lotteries wouldn’t be an issue if just 
      one user per household was doing them, but these puzzles have resulted in computer farms with hundreds, even 
      thousands of hard drives competing at a time. These are usually found in large warehouses with fans to keep
      them cool- but the issue is that each warehouse is producing enough power every 10 minutes to power the 
      entire state of Oregon. In this project, my hope is to find a sustainable way to produce these lotteries, 
      but also how to make sure Bitcoin isn’t the sole reason for our global collapse. </p>
