    <h1>Background and Review of the Literature</h1>
    <p>      The first piece of literature I have found for this project is an article in the New York
      Times written by Elizabeth Kolbert, titled Why Bitcoin Is Bad For The Environment. In this 
      article, she touches on a lot of important subjects, some of which I was already aware of such as
      the power usage bitcoin produces comparatively to other small countries of states, the whole 
      process of mining, and how bitcoin itself works like a currency. I have found that because of how
      new this technology is, even though it was created in 2008 it has only gained popularity recently,
      there isn’t a lot of reliable studies that have gone on. I also found that most of the sources or
      articles I find leave gaps in the research, such as in this NYT article where she doesn't discuss
      the next steps after the environmental impact mining has, which a lot of researchers have done as
      well. My next step after this outline is to start going on to the bitcoin sites, or read about 
      the founders and what their original goal was when developing this program. For my scholarly 
      resource, I found an amazing book written on the topic of Virtual Ethnography, which is the type
      of research method I will be using. More specifically I am going to be using the chapter titled 
      The Virtual Objects of Ethnography, to aid in my explanation in my methods and design section. 
      The question I am using as the basis of my research is “How can Bitcoin become environmentally 
      sustainable?”</p>
