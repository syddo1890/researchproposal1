    <p>      The first piece of literature I have found for this project is an article in the New York Times written 
      by Elizabeth Kolbert, titled Why Bitcoin Is Bad For The Environment. In this article, she touches on a lot of 
      important subjects, some of which I was already aware of such as the power usage bitcoin produces comparatively 
      to other small countries of states, the whole process of mining, and how bitcoin itself works like a currency. 
      The conversation that is happening around digital currency is very two-sided, you have one opinion that has the 
      mindset that this is the biggest thing to happen since computers and that you need to get on and invest before 
      it’s too late. But then there are people that understand that this is a big technological advancement and it 
      will be successful but only if the environmental impacts are addressed in a timely manner compared to how much 
      time we have left until the damage is irreversible. I am still trying to find reliable peer-reviewed sources 
      because of how biased these conversations seem to be, most of the ones I have found that support Bitcoin/Bitcoin 
      mining leave out all of the important stats about power usage or global warming. I also have found that because 
      of how new this technology is, even though it was created in 2008 it has only gained popularity recently, there 
      isn’t a lot of reliable studies that have gone on. I have also found that most of the sources or articles I find 
      leave gaps in the research, such as in this NYT article where she doesn't discuss the next steps after the 
      environmental impact mining has, which a lot of researchers have done as well. My next step after this outline 
      is to start going on to the bitcoin sites, or read about the founders and what their original goal was when 
      developing this program. The question I am using as the basis of my research is “How can Bitcoin become 
      environmentally sustainable?”</p>
