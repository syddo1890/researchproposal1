    <h1>Method</h1>
    <p> For my method section, when it comes to collecting the actual data I plan on looking into several things but 
      my starting point will be through public users of crypto interfaces, or also followers of popular crypto social
      media accounts. For conducting my research I plan on using what is called “Cyber-Ethnography”, which focuses on
      participant observation but in chat rooms, or online servers, and online interviewing or other virtual data 
      collection. In Catherine Hine’s book Virtual Ethnogrpahy she talks about how “Visiting the Internet focuses on 
      experiential rather than physical displacement.” This was interesting when thinking about how to conduct my 
      research because the internet is still evolving before our eyes and isn’t as simple observing people in the real
      world. This however can play to my strengths because crypto is based entirely online I know for a fact all of 
      their users will have some sort of digital footprint and ensures that the people I am reaching out to will be
      within the concentrated area of study. I understand that trying to collect data from people through online 
      information or rooms can be difficult, many people these days run through anonymous IPs or usernames so how 
      can I try to get demographics from them. I plan on creating a form similar to the one linked above, and sending
      this as a mass message to those users on social media sites such as Instagram, Twitter, and even Reddit. I 
      want to target users who seem to be active, including having a profile photo and a post within the last two
      years. This selection will be important to the responses because if I spend my time sending messages to 
      thousands of users, my ratio of responses to not will be drastically different than if I primarily focused 
      on active users. I imagine the participants will be of a younger age range for the pure fact that these are
      the people that usually don’t have any large investments or businesses yet, and are more open to the idea of
      a startup. After identifying those participants I will send them an anonymous message about their thoughts 
      on crypto and the environmental impact it is creating, looking for their feedback on if a better system is 
      even wanted from the community in the first place. I believe that most crypto users aren’t aware of the mass 
      environmental impact it will have in the future if it continues at the large scale it is already.</p>

    <h1>Design</h1>
      <p> When thinking about conducting this participant observation through merely online interactions there are 
        several things that come into play. First and foremost being that they have the option to ignore my message, 
        think it’s a scam, or just never see it. Next to that, they are wary of filling out my form for the matter of
        anonymity or it is just a large-scale pyramid or Ponzi scheme. Even outside this participant observation, I 
        also need for the participants to want to see this happen, I can go through and lay down the groundwork but 
        it doesn’t matter if those in the crypto community aren’t ready to see changes. I plan on looking at the 
        article Life Cycle Assessment of Bitcoin Mining by Susanne Köhler, and Massimo Pizzol because it follows a 
        similar model for the project I am essentially doing the ethnographic research for. The google doc,
        featured above, will act as a mode of communication between me and the participants. My hope is that after 
        obtaining most if not all sent out forms, to then dissect them to determine; first what they are ultimately
        looking for if new software is developed, next how they would like to see this integrated into current 
        conditions, and finally what expectations they have for this project I am proposing. Throughout all of the 
        data and numbers I plan on looking at throughout this process, my hope is that it will lead me to the 
        conclusion that a new procedure needs to be enacted to prevent irreversible environmental impact.  </p>
