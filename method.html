    <h1>Method</h1>
    <p> For my method section, when it comes to collecting the actual data I plan on looking into several things but
      my starting point will be through public users of crypto interfaces, or also followers of popular crypto social 
      media accounts. For conducting my research I plan on using what is called “Cyber-Ethnography”, which focuses on
      participant observation but in chat rooms, or online servers, and online interviewing or other virtual data 
      collection. I understand that trying to collect data from people through online information or rooms can be 
      difficult, many people these days run through anonymous IPs or usernames so how can I try to get demographics 
      from them. I plan on creating a form similar to the one linked above, and sending this as a mass message to those
      users on social media sites such as Instagram, Twitter, and even Reddit. I want to target users who seem to be
      active, including having a profile photo and a post within the last two years. This selection will be important
      to the responses because if I spend my time sending messages to thousands of users, my ratio of responses to not
      will be drastically different than if I primarily focused on active users. I imagine the participants will be 
      of a younger age range for the pure fact that these are the people that usually don’t have any large investments
      or businesses yet, and are more open to the idea of a startup. After identifying those participants I will send
      them an anonymous message about their thoughts on crypto and the environmental impact it is creating, looking 
      for their feedback on if a better system is even wanted from the community in the first place. I believe that 
      most crypto users aren’t aware of the mass environmental impact it will have in the future if it continues at 
    the large scale it is already.</p>
    <h1>Design</h1>
      <p> When thinking about conducting this participant observation through merely online interactions 
      there are several things that come into play. First and foremost being that they have the option to ignore
      my message, think it’s a scam, or just never see it. Next to being that they don’t yield the results I'm looking 
      for such as wanting a more sustainable future for crypto. Even outside this participant observation, there are
      variables in the software I’m designing, to either go with a USB type software where each crypto user would have
      to purchase or obtain in order to access the domain. Or also to have “hubs” per 1,000 users that they use for
      their own access, but this might not be easy in places like LA and New York where the majority of its American 
      users lie. Also within each option (USB vs hubs), there is the actual power usage each uses comparatively to
      the current conditions, to figure this out I am in the process of creating an equation to use in the final 
      proposal to explain the long term effects of each one has. I plan on having futuristic graphs for each model 
      to see which will be more environmentally sustainable at the end versus the way we are currently headed. To 
      confirm my hypothesis that a new approach needs to be created to prevent a global collapse, these graphs I will 
      include need to show that the new device will last longer, provide less atmospheric gas, and have less power usage.
      On the other hand, I also need for the participants to want to see this happen, I can go through and create a
      perfect device but it doesn’t matter if those in the crypto community aren’t ready to see changes. I am also 
      planning on looking at the article Life Cycle Assessment of Bitcoin Mining by Susanne Köhler, and Massimo Pizzol
      because it follows a similar model for the graphs and equations I am looking to create involving power usage
      and sustainability. Throughout all of the data and numbers I plan on looking at throughout this process, my 
      hope is that it will lead me to the conclusion that a new procedure needs to be enacted to prevent irreversible
      environmental impact. </p>
