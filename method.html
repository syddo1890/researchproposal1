    <p>Method: For my method section, when it comes to collecting the actual data I plan on looking 
      into several things but my starting point will be through power reports and daily usage numbers,
      online traffic information, and the number of total users of cryptocurrency versus their respective
      power usage because of the software needed. For conducting my research I plan on using what is called 
      “Cyber-Ethnography”, which focuses on participant observation but in chat rooms, or online servers, and
      online interviewing or other virtual data collection. I understand that trying to collect data from people
      through online information or rooms can be difficult, many people these days run through anonymous IPs
      or usernames so how can I try to get demographics from them. I plan on essentially having these online
      users come to me- by creating new software that can cut down on total power usage per person, but also 
      create an even playing field for those interested in fresh BitCoin. Recently with the rise in popularity 
      of cryptocurrency, many people are wishing they could have been like those in 2008 that are now millionaires
      from investing, users are on the hunt for what could be the next big thing. I want to play into this trait 
      and offer a new software, where instead of Bitcoin giving away fresh coins to whoever uses the most power 
      to solve a problem fastest, the puzzles require thought and are available to anyone across the platform,
      not just those with warehouses of computers. My next step after identifying those who are interested in a
      more sustainable software would be to create a model of where it will work, what countries/provinces have 
      wifi to power this new device, and also where the mass amount of users are for cryptocurrency. Another 
      thing I have to think about is not only the anonymity that users want, but that a lot of Bitcoin is going 
      into offshore accounts and transactions for users aren’t public. I am going to start with finding 50 users 
      from popular NFT/Crypto accounts, who live within those countries that have the wifi needed and are within 
      the age ranges of 18-25. I chose a younger age range for the pure fact that these are the people that usually 
      don’t have any large investments or businesses yet, and are more open to the idea of a startup. After 
      identifying those participants I will send them an anonymous message about their thoughts on crypto and 
      the environmental impact it is having if they are open to a new device that can help decrease the impact, 
      and also what they would want to see out of a new device or from online crypto sites.<br>
      Design: When thinking about conducting this participant observation through merely online interactions 
      there are several things that come into play. First and foremost being that they have the option to ignore
      my message, think it’s a scam, or just never see it. Next to being that they don’t yield the results I'm looking 
      for such as wanting a more sustainable future for crypto. Even outside this participant observation, there are
      variables in the software I’m designing, to either go with a USB type software where each crypto user would have
      to purchase or obtain in order to access the domain. Or also to have “hubs” per 1,000 users that they use for
      their own access, but this might not be easy in places like LA and New York where the majority of its American 
      users lie. Also within each option (USB vs hubs), there is the actual power usage each uses comparatively to
      the current conditions, to figure this out I am in the process of creating an equation to use in the final 
      proposal to explain the long term effects of each one has. I plan on having futuristic graphs for each model 
      to see which will be more environmentally sustainable at the end versus the way we are currently headed. To 
      confirm my hypothesis that a new approach needs to be created to prevent a global collapse, these graphs I will 
      include need to show that the new device will last longer, provide less atmospheric gas, and have less power usage.
      On the other hand, I also need for the participants to want to see this happen, I can go through and create a
      perfect device but it doesn’t matter if those in the crypto community aren’t ready to see changes. I am also 
      planning on looking at the article Life Cycle Assessment of Bitcoin Mining by Susanne Köhler, and Massimo Pizzol
      because it follows a similar model for the graphs and equations I am looking to create involving power usage
      and sustainability. Throughout all of the data and numbers I plan on looking at throughout this process, my 
      hope is that it will lead me to the conclusion that a new procedure needs to be enacted to prevent irreversible
      environmental impact. </p>
