    <h1>Significance and Conclusion</h1>
    <p>The current bitcoin and online crypto purchases cannot continue with their current power usage and the 
      state of the world, so my plan is to test out the waters within the user interface and see if the 
      participants are ready to see a new era of crypto, one that can last for several years to come. If 
      successful I plan on targeting large crowds of users in the digital banking community, along with those 
      involved with NFTâ€™s and other digital additions. The results would hopefully be that there would be a 
      transition to decentralize their power source, just like they wanted to do with the current banking system.
      After conducting the initial research to figure out what kind of new software the users would like to see
      if any, I want to pass this information on to someone who can then develop the specific software. My 
      purpose throughout this project has been to do all of the initial data collection within the users, and
      then working with those in engineering or computer science to further the idea. I plan on looking into 
      current users and their demographics by country, how many current users are owners of large mining 
      operations, but I also plan on comparing up to date analytics on ATM  and banks power usage to compare 
      it to crypto usage. When first starting this proposal I knew it would be a lot of work to reach out to 
      all of these participants, but the importance comes from knowing that there is a need for the product. 
      There would be no success if a largescale project was conducted but there was no desire for it within
      the field of observation. Overall my hope is that my hypothesis is correct in that a new way of thinking
      can be developed in order to reduce power usage from this new digital currency era we are entering. </p>
