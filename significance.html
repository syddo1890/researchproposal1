    <p>When I look back on the work I plan on doing for this project I not only am realizing the amount of 
      data I will obtain, but more importantly what could happen if I successfully create a more sustainable
      way of obtaining cryptocurrency. The current bitcoin and online crypto purchases cannot continue with 
      their current power usage and the state of the world, so my plan is to introduce a new, more efficient 
      way of mining for bitcoin and for their transactions as well. If successful I plan on marketing to large
      crowds of users in the digital banking community, along with those involved with NFT’s and other digital
      additions. The results would hopefully be that there would be a transition to decentralize their power 
      source, just like they wanted to do with the current banking system. Whether it be USB-type devices or
      hubs as mentioned earlier in a certain radius of users per capita, it has to be more sustainable. I plan 
      on looking into current users and their demographics by country, how many current users are owners of 
      large mining operations, but I also plan on comparing up to date analytics on ATM  and banks power usage
      to compare it to crypto usage, but also what would happen if all banks and ATM’s ceased. Overall my hope 
      is that my hypothesis is correct in that a new way of thinking can be developed in order to reduce power
      usage from this new digital currency era we are entering. </p>
