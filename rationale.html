    <h1>Rationale</h1>
    <p>  In alignment with the question stated above- “How can Bitcoin become more environmentally 
      sustainable?”- I also plan on specifically looking at users of crypto interfaces and interacting
      with them. My purpose in this project is to directly draw data from willing participants that 
      come from either followers of large crypto accounts on social media, or those who post under 
      certain hashtags, therefore, making them a part of my subjects. My hypothesis is that 50% of users
      I reach out to will not participate for that fact of either not seeing the message, or also 
      thinking it is a scam or bot. The hypothesis, if proven correct, will benefit me from being able
      to have accurate data from 50% or more of the chosen participants.  I am not very familiar with 
      computer hardware but have had conversations about Bitcoin and the Metaverse in my business 
      classes where it was all very out of my league with the language they were using. However, thanks
      to YouTube, I have found several videos and creators that will help introduce you to the “language
      of Bitcoin” which is extremely in-depth. I plan on exploring and quite frankly falling down a 
      rabbit hole of this community, there has been no advertising of these companies so looking into
      why the sudden spike in popularity. Within these messages I am sending out to the participants 
      stated above, I will include a form for them to fill out to figure out if they are wanting a more
      environmentally stable future for crypto. My purpose in this project is to lay down the groundwork
      to see if a project of the magnitude to create an entirely new sustainable software would even do
      well within the field. </p>
