    <p>  Along with the question stated above- “How can Bitcoin become more environmentally sustainable?”- 
      I also want to look more into how Bitcoin as a company can handle these mass amounts of traffic on their 
      programs. Some specific questions I am using for my research include, but are not limited to; where did 
      the spike in Bitcoin members come from, how do the creators make money from these transactions and lotteries,
      and how was such a large, tight-knit community created from an online banking platform. I am not very familiar
      with computer hardware but have had conversations about Bitcoin and the Metaverse in my business classes where
      it was all very out of my league with the language they were using. However, thanks to YouTube, I have found
      several videos and creators that will help introduce you to the “language of Bitcoin” which is extremely in-depth.
      I plan on exploring and quite frankly falling down a rabbit hole of this community, there has been no advertising 
      of these companies so looking into why the sudden spike in popularity. Along with these plans I want to actually 
      map out and use current data to see how long Bitcoin could keep up with the power usage before the environmental 
      impact has passed repair. My hypothesis is that Bitcoin does not have any regard to the global impact they have
      because of their power usage and their sole purpose is to make money and decentralize banking. If this is proven 
      true it will not only further the conversation on the negative impact this has, but it might bring about some
      progress in finding a solution to the problem of power usage. But however, if I don’t find anything suspicious 
      within their coding and actions it would mean that the next step to preventing global collapse would be to de-digitize
      these transactions, like physical locations and physical puzzles or lotteries. </p>
